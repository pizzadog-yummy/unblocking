### Deploy this app

How to deploy this app to localhost / network

**Unix:**
### 1. Cloning the Code
- Clone the repository to your local machine. You can skip the `node_modules/` folder if you already have it, as you'll need to reinstall the dependencies.

### 2. Installing Node.js and npm
- **Node.js**: Node.js includes npm (Node Package Manager), so you only need to install Node.js.
- **Installation**:
  1. Install Homebrew if you don't have it already. You can install it by running the following command in your terminal:
     `bash /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
  2. Use Homebrew to install the latest version of Node.js by running:
     `brew install node@latest`
     This will install both Node.js and npm.

### 3. Installing Dependencies
- Open your terminal.
- Navigate to the project directory. If you saved it to a folder named "proxy" in your home directory, use the command:
  `cd ~/proxy`
